# Pongout 3D

A multiplayer 3D pong game using Three.js and MultiSynq for real-time synchronization.

## Current Status

âœ… Working:
- Real-time synchronized multiplayer sessions
- 3D graphics with Three.js
- Automatic player color assignment (orange/blue)
- Physics-based ball movement and collisions
- Larger play area (70x40 units)
- Ball boundary detection and bouncing

ðŸ”„ In Progress:
- Paddle movement controls
- Player input synchronization
- Collision response tuning

## Technical Implementation

### Model (Game Logic)
- Synchronized game state using MultiSynq
- Physics calculations for ball movement
- Collision detection system
- Player management and paddle assignment

### View (Graphics)
- 3D scene rendering with Three.js
- Dynamic lighting with ambient and directional lights
- Material system with metalness and roughness
- Responsive window resizing

### Controls (Work in Progress)
- Arrow Up: Move paddle up
- Arrow Down: Move paddle down

## Architecture

The game follows MultiSynq's model-view pattern:

- **Model**: Handles game logic, physics, and state synchronization
- **View**: Manages 3D rendering and player input
- **Session**: Coordinates real-time multiplayer updates

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install three @multisynq/client
```
3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Multiplayer

1. First player opens the game and gets assigned orange paddle
2. Share the URL from browser (contains session ID)
3. Second player opens shared URL and gets blue paddle
4. Both players see synchronized ball movement

## Next Steps

1. Fix paddle movement controls
2. Add debug logging for input handling
3. Verify player assignment and control mapping
4. Test paddle collision responses
5. Add score tracking system
6. Implement brick wall in center area
